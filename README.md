# The-Solution-of-Multipath-Fading-Problem-at-Receiver-in-Underwater-Acoustic-Channel
The aim of the paper is to mitigate the effects of multipath fading at the receiver in underwater acoustic communication channel. Our approach leverages the frequency spectrum analysis of the composite received signal to identify the most reliable information-bearing frequency.
